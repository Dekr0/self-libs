Assignment 1: OO Classifier


Included Files:
    * ooclassifier.py
    * README

Running Instructions:
    To launch the program:
        In terminal, execute "python3 ooclassifier.py <file>"
    To test the program using driver:
        In terminal, execute "python3 <driver_file_name.py> <file>"
    "<file>" will be the file contains all the training data


Notes and Assumption:
    This program passed all the driver test provided from different version of
    "Sample.Output.n" folder from eClass. Specifically, the output files
    generated by the Makefile had minor differences due to the fact that
    the target words are in different orders. The differences are identified
    by using "diff" built-in tool in Linux system.
