Notes:

1.  Read the comments in the Makefile

2.  a1.alldriver.v3.py tests the n-fold (Task III) functionality more,
	and shows cross-validation.

3.  Look for the correct outputs in:

	data.v1.correct.output.v3
	helpdata.v1.correct.output.v3
	driverdata.v1.correct.output.v3

4.  In the output, there is a line of debugging output starting with:

	"Not part of Task II: Your output might be in different order.  Debug:  Word Frequency:"

	Note:
	(a) This is provided to help you debug your code.
	(b) Your program should **NOT** produce this output.  It is not
		part of the program specification.
	(c) The order of the key-value pairs in your output *might* be
		different.  That is OK.  Only the counts should be the same,
		not the order.
