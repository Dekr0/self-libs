Exercise 3: Word Frequency


Included Files:
    * freq.py
    * README


Running Instructions:
    To analyze words frequency in a text from a text file:
    In terminal (in the directory that contains all the file mention in "Included Files"), type "python3 freq.py <input_file_name>" (<input_file_name> is the file going to be analyze)


Notes and Assumptions:
    This program will perform frquency analysis on words in an input text and output a sorted frequency table in lexicographic order.

    The file freq.py expects to accecpt exactly two command line arguments when it launches. Argument "freq.py" is mandatory because it's required to launch the program. The last argument will be the name of file going to be analyzed (referred as input file). The input file needs to exist in the local storage, otherwise the program will exit because it can't find such file to open. If the input file is not in the same directory as the freq.py file, a relative path or absolute path is required to provide. 

    An corresponding output file with same name as the name of the input file but with an additional file extentsion ".out" will be generated by the program. The output file will contains the result of the analysis. Notice that the program will stil analyze an input file although it is empty, consequently, an empty output file will also be generated.
