Exercise 4: Text Preprocessor


Included Files:
    * preprocess.py
    * README


Running Instructions:
    To launch the program and preprocess a space-separated line of words
    In terminal, execute "python3 preprocess.py <mode>"
    "<mode>" is an optional argument, which keep specific types of characters,
    can be one of three following:
        - "keep-digits": do not remove numbers from words
        - "keep-stops": do not remove stopwords
        - "keep-symbols": do not remove punctuation or symbols
    If there's no optional argument provided, all preprocess steps perform


Notes and Assumption:
    This program will take only one space-separated line of words and perform
    all the preprocess steps in order (removing all punctuation, symbols, di-
    -gits, and stopwords) unless <mode> argument is provided for keeping spe-
    -cific type of characters

    This program will automatically quit before performing all the preproces-
    sed step if one of following happen:
        - too many arguments are provided
        - provided mode isn't recognizable by the program

    After all preprocessing steps, an result, which consists of the word has
    not been completely removed, will be printed
