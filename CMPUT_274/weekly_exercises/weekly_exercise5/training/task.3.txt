#hardware nvidia latest rtx 30s GPUs
#hardware nvidia rtx 20s graphic cards
#hardware some cooling towers require the case with larger width
#hardware the clock speed is 4.0 Ghz
#hardware overclocking increases the clock speed
#hardware m.2 solid state drives has faster read and write access
#hardware the Southbridge is one of the two chipset in the core logic
#hardware the Intel CPUs have different sockets
#hardware SATA drives might need external brackets to mount in the case
#hardware old graphic cards generally are less power efficient
#hardware b450 motherboards support both Ryzen 3000 series
#hardware 6 cores / 12 threads processor
#hardware this graphic card running in boost clock speed
#hardware SSDs have faster read and write access compared to HHDs
#hardware overclocking might permanently damage the CPUs
#hardware PSUs with gold certification has 90% efficiency at 50% system load
#hardware solid state drives have two types: sata and m.2
#hardware dual channel RAM is one version of multi-channel memory
#hardware watch batteries turn on the CMOS memory for date and time in the BIOS chip
#hardware taking off CMOS battery can reset the BIOS state
#hardware integrated graphic cards
#hardware air cooler on graphic cards generally produce much noise than usual under high pressure
#hardware some graphic cards allow air fans stay in silent mode under low pressure
#hardware high-end graphic cards generally draw more wattage
#hardware liquid cooling system require the case larger height and length
#hardware built-in wireless network card
#hardware the BIOS is unable to recognize the hard drive
#hardware most of MBs have built-in sound card
#hardware debugging led helps identify issues happen in the board
#hardware archive hard drives are usually built with SMR technology
#hardware what is difference between CUDA cores and Tensor cores
#hardware heat sink and heat pipes are widely used in graphic cards and air cooler
#hardware mechanical failure on hard drive is difficult or nearly impossible to fix
#hardware the 24-pin ATX connector is being replaced by a new 10 pin connector
#hardware most of the monitor support FreeSync
#hardware liquid cooler is more difficult to install into desktops compared to air cooler
#hardware overclocking memory clock speed is complicated overall
#hardware graphic cards usually uses either 6-Pin or 8-Pin connectors
