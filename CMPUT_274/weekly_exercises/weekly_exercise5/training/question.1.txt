The positive feature will directly affect the number of true positive (TP),
true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) cases in
the sentiment analysis. Changes in positive features will result a change
in measurement and evaluation of the sentiment analysis.

Instead of randomly trying words, the strategy of choosing positive feature
to result in a desired accuracy is based on the formula of accuracy. Since
the accuracy will increase as long as the sum of all TP and TN instances
increases , which is the numerator of the formula, the method to increase
accuracy is to either add features that can generate more TP cases and
less FP cases or removing features that can generate more FP cases rather
than TP cases. Consequently, number of FP and FN instances will decrease,
which is part of the denominator of the formula as number of TN and TP
instances increases.
