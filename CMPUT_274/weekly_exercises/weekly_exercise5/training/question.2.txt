The strategy in creating the new training instances for this task is to keep
the number of false negative and true positive cases in a specific ratio such
that can maintain a high precision and low accuracy as long as no increment
appears in the number of false positive and true negative cases. This strategy
is based on the property of the accuracy and the precision formula. In order
to increase precision, it need to either increase the number of TP cases or
lower the number of FP cases (denominator). Meanwhile, the number of TP cases
is also limited because it's one of the factors increase accuracy, which
requires the number of FP cases to constraints the effect or lower the accuracy
. The training instances that labelled as positive but does not contain
positive features, known as false negative instances, can increase precision
but decrease accuracy. For instances, "archive hard drives are built drives
are usually built with SMR technology" is about hardware, and it mentions the
full name of HHDs instead; "debugging led helps identify issues happen in the
board" is talking about one of the features on motherboards".
